topic: ACL 2023 Tutorial - Complex Reasoning in Natural Language
abstract: Teaching machines to reason over texts has been a long-standing goal of natural language processing (NLP). In this tutorial, we will review (1) complex reasoning tasks that involve compositional reasoning, knowledge retrieval, grounding, commonsense reasoning, etc. and (2) knowledge-augmented training approaches to enhance the reasoning performance of NLP models.
