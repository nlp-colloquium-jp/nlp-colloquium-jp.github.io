topic: Towards Fully Automated Manga Translation
abstract: >
We tackle the problem of machine translation of manga. Manga translation involves two important problems in MT: context-aware and multimodal translation. Since text and images are mixed up in an unstructured fashion in manga, obtaining context from the image is essential for its translation. However, it is still an open problem how to extract context from images and integrate it into MT models. In addition, corpora and benchmarks to train and evaluate such models are currently unavailable. In the talk, we discuss our work that establishes the foundation of manga translation research including i) a multimodal context-aware translation framework, ii) the approach to automatic corpus construction from manga images, and iii) a new benchmark to evaluate manga translation.
