topic: Editing and Diffusion for Text Generation
abstract: In this talk, I will present DiffusER, a new text generation model that is based on denoising diffusion models. DiffusER is able to perform edit-based generation, allowing it to revise existing text, a capability that current models lack. In addition to being a strong generative model on its own, DiffusER can also perform other types of generation, such as allowing a user to condition generation on a prototype or incomplete sequence and revise based on previous edits. In comparison to existing models, DiffusER performs well on a range of tasks including machine translation, summarization, and style transfer.
